## Part A

Using the sample email below:

What's up homie,

We have a project coming up in class this week. We need to form groups of 5. If you decide to join our group, we would need one more person. None of us are good with switch statements yet, if you could find one more person thats good with those we would be set.

Also, since we need to meet remotely could you request that the teachers let us use their professional zoom account?

Thanks <br>
